# OliveTree
Suite of three complementary tools, RAxML-NG-and-Friends, ETElib and OliveTree, which have been designed to streamline the analysis, manipulation and advanced visualization of phylogenetic data by combining the functionality of the most popular phylogenetic tools and frameworks. RAxML-NG-and-Friends is an automated Snakemake pipeline for performing Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis using RAxML-NG and associated tools (PyPythia, ModelTest-NG). ETElib is a Python library with a number of useful functions for effective tree manipulation based on the ETE3 toolkit. OliveTree is a novel R library for advanced tree visualization by combining functionality from the ggtree, phytools, ape, treeio and TreeTools packages.
